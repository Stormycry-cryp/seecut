//! The reader pool and frame cache: random access to any frame of any file.
//!
//! A decoder on its own reads *forward*: open it, pull frames in order,
//! drop it. That is exactly right for export and exactly wrong for
//! interactive use, where scrubbing asks for arbitrary (media, time) pairs.
//! This module is the answer:
//!
//! - **One reader per (file, size, chain)**, kept warm between requests. A
//!   request near the reader's current position rolls forward (cheap,
//!   exact); a request elsewhere seeks - frame-accurately, guided by the
//!   real timestamps the linked decoder reports.
//! - **A byte-budgeted LRU frame cache** in front of the readers. Scrubbing
//!   back over ground just covered, or dwelling on one frame, costs a hash
//!   lookup. Frames roll into the cache as decoding passes them, so rolling
//!   forward to frame N caches N-1 frames of the path there.
//!
//! The pool is deliberately not used by export: export decodes every frame
//! exactly once in order, and a cache in that path is pure overhead. This is
//! playback infrastructure.
