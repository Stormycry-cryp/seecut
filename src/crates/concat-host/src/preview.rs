//! The paused monitor's true frame.
//!
//! One reader pool for the app's lifetime: its whole value is what stays
//! warm between scrubs. The pool locks per reader, so a frame is decoded on
//! whatever thread the caller chose while another thread decodes ahead on a
//! different file - the window debounces and drops stale results, so a slow
//! decode never wedges anything but itself.
//!
//! With the `gpu` feature and a device from [`Monitor::with_gpu`], a frame
//! is drawn on that device and handed back as a texture: decoded pictures
//! go up once, the composite happens where it is shown, and no pixel comes
//! back down. A frame is therefore two calls and not one -
//! [`Monitor::frame_sources`] anywhere, [`Monitor::texture_of`] on the
//! thread that owns the device - because the drawing is not a thing a
//! worker may do; see `texture_of`.
