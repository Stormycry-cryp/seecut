Concat is everything you use CapCut for. No watermarks. No paywalls. No subscriptions.

It runs entirely on your machine, powered by a native Rust engine. Install it and start cutting. No account, no setup.

## Highlights

- 🚫 **No watermarks.** No account. No paywall.
- 🔒 **100% local.** Nothing leaves your machine.
- 🎬 **Multi-track editing.** Several timelines per project.
- ✂️ **Cut fast.** Split, trim, merge, transitions, speed control.
- 💬 **Auto-captions.** Runs on your machine, offline.
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech.** Free, local voices.
- 🎙️ **Voice filters.** Clean up or play with your sound.
- 📝 **Titles and styled text.**
- 📦 **Templates.** Build an edit once, reuse it.
- 🖥️ **macOS, Windows and Linux.** Same app everywhere.
- 🌍 **Twelve languages.** Add one with a single JSON file, see [TRANSLATING.md](TRANSLATING.md).

## Get started

Concat is currently in **Beta version (pre-release)**. **Download** the latest build from [Releases](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/releases).

**Portable:** the Windows and Linux builds are plain archives. To keep everything on the stick or in the folder you unpacked into, make a folder named `portable` beside the `concat` executable: settings, recents and downloaded models then live there and nothing is written to the user profile.

**Reporting something:** every run writes a log, and Settings › About has the button that opens it along with the one that copies your system information. Attach both to an [issue](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/issues) and the report arrives with everything it needs. The last ten runs are kept, so yesterday's is still there; nothing is ever sent anywhere on its own.

**Platform support:**

- ✅ **Windows**
  - ✅ x86_64
- ✅ **macOS** — unsigned binaries; run:
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Concat.app`
  - ✅ Intel
  - ✅ Silicon
- ✅ **Linux**
  - ✅ ARM
  - ✅ x86_64
- ✅ **Android**
  - ✅ Phones
  - ✅ Tablets
- 🧪 **iOS / iPadOS**
  - 🧪 iPhone
  - 🧪 iPad

**Status:** ✅ Supported · 🚧 Work in progress · 🧪 To be tested

**System requirements:**

Concat runs everything on your machine, so the hardware sets the ceiling. The minimum column is what a build will run on at all; the recommended column is what makes 1080p editing feel smooth and keeps 4K exports and captions from being a wait.

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| **CPU** | Any 64-bit processor from 2013 or later | 6 cores or more |
| **GPU** | None. Without a usable GPU the window and monitor fall back to the CPU | Any GPU with Metal (macOS), DirectX 12 (Windows) or Vulkan (Linux) |
| **RAM** | **4 GB** | **16 GB** for 4K timelines and the larger caption models |
| **Storage** | **500 MB** for the app and the smallest caption model | **2 GB** for every optional model, plus room for projects and exports |

Optional models download from the settings panel on first use and then never need the network again: auto-captions 78 MB to 488 MB depending on the whisper size you pick, text-to-speech 132 MB or 349 MB, person cutout 15 MB, object cutout 179 MB, and the cutout brush 40 MB.

## Contribution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The best way to contribute is to grab a build from the [Release](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/releases) page and test the application to see where it breaks or how it can be improved.

Ready to write code? [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) covers setup, layout, the checks to run, and how contributions are licensed. There is also [this Discussion announcement](https://github.com/jub0t/Concat/discussions/3). Read [ROADMAP.MD](./ROADMAP.MD) for future goals.
